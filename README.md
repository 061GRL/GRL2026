Datasets in GRL paper
The presented datasets are used in the paper submitted to Geophysical Research Letter. They will be public when the paper is in publication. 
Two datasets in Matlab format are uploaded with the names of "DataS1.mat" and "DataS2.mat". 
(1) The "DataS1.mat", used in Figure S1, includes the modeled magnetic responses of total field anomaly (TFA) and magnetic gradient tensor components (Txx, Txy, Txz, Tyy, Tyz) with a data spacing of 2 m.
(2) The "DataS2.mat", used in Figure 2, includes the field magnetic tensor anomalies (Txx, Txy, Txz, Tyy, Tyz, and Tzz) and the total field anomaly (TFA) with a grid spacing of 220 m.
